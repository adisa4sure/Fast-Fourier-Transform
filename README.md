This project describes the Fast Fourier Transform using the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm. The motivation stems from finding a faster way to beat the Karatsuba Algorithm for high-degree polynomial multiplication.
The algorithm is implemented with a clear step-by-step, and compared to other algorithms regarding execution times.
